This project is an Arduino-based environmental and GPS tracking system designed to collect temperature, humidity, barometric pressure, altitude, and GPS coordinates, and store them on an SD card for later analysis. It uses a DHT12 sensor for temperature and humidity, a BMP280 for pressure and altitude, a NEO-6M GPS module for location data, and an SD card module for logging. The system is split into two dedicated Arduino units: one responsible for reading and transmitting GPS data, and another responsible for reading environmental sensors and logging all data to the SD card. Both Arduinos communicate through a simple serial connection, where the GPS Nano sends formatted location data that the logger Uno combines with local sensor readings and writes into a CSV file. The pins remain consistent with the original design: DHT12 on digital pin 2, BMP280 on I2C (A4/A5), SD card on SPI with CS at pin 8, and GPS connected by using only the TX pin since only receiving data is required. The project also includes wiring documentation, test examples, and troubleshooting notes to help users build, expand, and debug the system easily. The GitHub repository will contain separate folders for the environmental logger and GPS tracker codes, a documentation directory for wiring diagrams and images, and example sketches for testing individual components such as SD cards, DHT12, and GPS modules. This project is intended to be simple, modular, and fully open source—ideal for learners, hobbyists, and engineers who want to build a compact environmental and location data logging system using Arduino.
