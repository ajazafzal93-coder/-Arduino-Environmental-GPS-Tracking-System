Common issues and solutions:
For SD Card ERROR:

Check SD card is inserted properly
Verify wiring:

CS → Pin 8
MOSI → Pin 11
MISO → Pin 12
SCK → Pin 13
VCC → 5V
GND → GND


Try a different SD card (some cards don't work well)
Format SD card as FAT32

For DHT12 reading 0.0:

Verify it's actually DHT12 (not DHT11 or DHT22)
Check wiring:

VCC → 5V
GND → GND
DATA → Pin 2


DHT12 uses I2C by default! Try this alternative:

Connect to I2C: SDA → A4, SCL → A5
Or use 3-wire mode with 10kΩ pull-up resistor between DATA and VCC


Wait 2-3 seconds after power-on before first reading

Upload the updated code and tell me what error messages you see during initialization!
